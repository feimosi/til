## CSS `:focus-within`

A pseudo-class you add to an existing CSS selector, much like you would with `:focus` or `:hover`. The pseudo-class styling kicks in when either the element with :focus-within becomes focused, or a focusable child of that element is focused.

Use cases:
- Highlighting table rows
- Drop Down Navigation Menu
